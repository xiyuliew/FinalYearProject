# FinalYearProject FIT3036
Road Surface Estimation 

  The functional requirements of this project are that the program should have access to the Google Map and enable user to nominate a square. The program should be able to generate Static Map URL and send it to the server for further processing. The static image must be able to differentiate roads and non-roads. Correct total surface area of the road should be displayed in the client side for the user to see.
  Non-functional requirement of the program is can be run by any user without any difficulty. It is also expected to be able to run multiple times and displays different total surface area. The only project constraints of this project is that the Google Map database are outdated and the Google Map is not up to date which shows different data from the actual surface area.
